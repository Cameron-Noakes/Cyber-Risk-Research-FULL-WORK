# Cyber-Risk-Research-FULL-WORK
All of my work for the past 6 months as a cyber risk researcher for University of Greenwich. A total of 41 literature
reviews and analysis as white papers to develop the final survey paper.

### Overview ###
This is the complete work of a 6 month contract researcher position to develop findings about how MITRE ATT&CK can be 
used within various industrial sectors as a threat model to protect infrastructure systems.

There is also data science and analysis/graphing and tabling of all of this data in the excel file.
All of this work was needed to conclude with a final survey white paper which will be developed soon based on the 41 literature reviews.
